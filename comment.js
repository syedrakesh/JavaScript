/*
Starting variable name with uppercase is not good. It is not convention. Though, it is just convention do not use first letter of the variable uppercase. Breaking the convention is not good practice of coding.

// let Person = 'Syed Rakesh Uddin';


/*
Although 'name' is a keyword but we can use it in variable. But good practice is do not use 'name' in variable. Rather than we can use firstName or first_name. Or something meaningful.

// let name = 'Syed Rakesh Uddin';

/*
Variable name can not start with number or any character. But 
underscore _
dollar $
sign is acceptable.
